  \nExtract sliding local blocks from a batched input tensor.\n\nWarning\nCurrently,\
  \ only 4-D input tensors (batched image-like tensors) are\nsupported.\n\n\nWarning\n\
  More than one element of the unfolded tensor may refer to a single\nmemory location.\
  \ As a result, in-place operations (especially ones that\nare vectorized) may result\
  \ in incorrect behavior. If you need to write\nto the tensor, please clone it first.\n\
  \nSee torch.nn.Unfold for details\n\nReturn type\nTensor\n\n\n"
