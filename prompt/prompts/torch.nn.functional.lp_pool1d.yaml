doc: "\n\ntorch.nn.functional.lp_pool1d(input, norm_type, kernel_size, stride=None,\
  \ ceil_mode=False)[source]\xB6\nApply a 1D power-average pooling over an input signal\
  \ composed of several input planes.\nIf the sum of all inputs to the power of p\
  \ is\nzero, the gradient is set to zero as well.\nSee LPPool1d for details.\n\n\
  Return type\nTensor\n\n\n"
